  <h2 id="Q1">What <em>is</em> Climate Change?</h2>
<p>Climate change (or global warming), is the process of our planet heating up. 

The Earth has warmed by an average of 1°C in the last century, and although that might not sound like much, it means big things for people and wildlife around the globe.

Unfortunately, rising temperatures don’t just mean that we’ll get nicer weather – if only! The changing climate will actually make our weather more extreme and unpredictable. 

As temperatures rise, some areas will get wetter and lots of animals (and humans!) could find they’re not able to adapt to their changing climate. </p>

  <h2 id="Q2">What <em>needs</em> to change?</h2>
<p>Small changes in your own home can make a difference, too. Try switching to energy-saving lightbulbs, walking instead of using the car, turning off electrical items when you’re not using them, recycling and reducing your food waste. All these little things can make a difference.</p>

  <h2 id="Q3">What can <em>we</em> do?</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Avoid Palm Oil!</li>
    <li>Turn Off The Taps!</li>
    <li>Be Switched On – Switch off Lights and Gadgets!</li>
    <li>Don’t Be Car Crazy!</li>
    <li>Say “No” To Plastic Bags!</li>
